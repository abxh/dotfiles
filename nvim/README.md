# nvim

This neovim configuration in particular can be subject to a lot of changes.

Neovim is very extensible editor with a evolving ecosystem of plugins. There are many
ways to the do the same thing. Some are better and others are worse in some aspects.

I think it's important to roll out your own configuration, rather than to use a
preconfigured neovim distro.

Do not regard this neovim configuration as some sort of a neovim distro. However, if
you are looking for a neovim distro, then consult the internet and use the most popular
ones. They are better maintained and they are probably configured better.

If you like some of the configuration I done, then feel free to copy them.
