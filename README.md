# dotfiles
Hey there, :). Feel free to take a look at the various dotfiles.

Copy the stuff you understand and leave the rest.

Use `stow.sh` if you understand the script and don't use all of the configs at the same time when starting out. 
Or don't use the script at all. You might break your current configuration.

Most dependencies should be inferrable from the config files or scripts themselves.

The only dependency that might be hard to find is this fork of the gruvbox material gtk theme I made. [Link](https://github.com/abxh/gruvbox-material-gtk).
