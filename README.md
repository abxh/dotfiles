## Intro
Hey there, :). Feel free to take a look at the various dotfiles. Use and copy them, if you understand what you are doing.

> **Note:** The following hyperlinks point to directories in this repo.

The window manager [i3](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/i3/config) is used with [sxhkd](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/sxhkd), which sets all the keybindings except modes.

The fancy blur effect and other effects comes from [picom](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/picom/picom.conf).

The bar uses [i3bar](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/i3/), [i3blocks](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/i3blocks) and [scripts](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/scripts/i3blocklets) to achieve it's magic.

Notifications are done through [dunst](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/dunst) with [scripts](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/scripts/dunstify).

Both the bar and notifications use icons from [my fork of the gruvbox-material-gtk theme](https://github.com/abxh/gruvbox-material-gtk) (with OneColored Icons).

Programs are launched using [rofi](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/rofi).

A combination of [zsh](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/zsh), [Alacritty](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/alacritty) and [neovim](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim)
is used as the shell, terminal and editor.

And finally [qutebrowser](https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles/tree/main/qutebrowser) is used. It is a keyboard-driven browser with vim-like bindings.
