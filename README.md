# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. As such, a lot of the configuration are tinkered for my use and liking. Feel free to copy the stuff you like and understand, and leave the rest.

Use `stow.sh` after testing `stow` out. It's a wonderful program that helps managing dotfiles.

Special dependencies are written within the files themselves. Most dependencies should be inferrable (or throw errors if missing). I use [this](https://github.com/abxh/gruvbox-material-gtk) icon theme in the screenshots and in my dunstify scripts as default.

To clone this repo with the submodules, run:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/abxh/dotfiles
```
